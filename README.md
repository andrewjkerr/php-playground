* Chapter 1: I am currently working my way through ["PHP and MySQL Web Development" by Welling and Thomson](http://www.amazon.com/MySQL-Development-Edition-Developers-Library-ebook/dp/B000VMBXEY) to refresh on PHP and this directory contains all of the files that I am working on that relate to that chapter.
